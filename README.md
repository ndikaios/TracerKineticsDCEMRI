# TracerKineticsDCEMRI
Python functions to simulate Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance abdominal images based on ground truth tracer kinetics.

Run SimulateDCE.py to generate ground truth tracer kinetics  (ve, vp, Ktrans, onset time, gamma) for the extended Toft model and dual input liver model and simulated DCE MR images. You can change acquisition parameters and the ground truth values If you wish.
